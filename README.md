RULES:
You have to move your python to avoid falling objects (squares). Controlling is simple. Push your right or left key and python will move. But be aware of boundaries, you can crash them too. 
With every square grows the speed of falling objects. So be careful and watch out! 


For starting the game you need just run the Race file.

Enjoy playing!
